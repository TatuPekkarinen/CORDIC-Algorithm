### CORDIC Algorithm
> CORDIC algorithm that calculates sin & cos. Read couple of math papers on this and tried to do my best on this implementation. Works by magic and carried heavily by mathematicians who came up with this so im not the wizard.

*Only works with 0 - 89+ / 0 - 89- (degrees) and some day will fix it (maybe)*
