### CORDIC Algorithm
> CORDIC algorithm that calculates Sin & Cos. Read couple of math papers on this and tried to do my best on this. Works by magic and I dont understand the math behind other than in a engineering mindset way. Inspired from engineering mathematics class discussion of how Sin, Cos & Tan.
